All big objects are realized with the Entity class. You can assign aspects to an Entity.

Fields are public not private, if there is no obvious benefit of privacy.

Maybe this is a violation of OOP-principles. The Entity class is more a data struct than a normal OOP-class.

These ideas are part of a concept which is called Entity Aspects.
