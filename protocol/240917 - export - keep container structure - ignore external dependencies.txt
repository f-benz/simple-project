Exporting an entity means the following:
- the fields of the entity get exported
- If the entity is a container: the contained objects are exported
- external dependencies will not be exported

There is also another kind of export: the flat export. The flat export means:
- the fields of the entity get exported
- all dependencies will be included (in one container)
